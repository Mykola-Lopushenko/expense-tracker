## Features

- **Authentication** — Register and sign in with email and password. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt; sessions use JWT tokens.
- **Private data** — Each user only sees their own expenses. No crossover between accounts.
- **Add, edit, and delete expenses** — Full CRUD with description, amount, category, and date.
- **Period filtering** — View expenses by All, Today, This Week, This Month, or a specific date.
- **Budget tracking** — Live progress bar showing spending against a $1,000 monthly budget.
- **Category breakdown** — Color-coded by Food, Groceries, Transport, and Other.
- **Data insights** — On-demand summary statistics, budget alert, monthly report, and keyword search.
- **Responsive design** — Works on desktop and mobile with a collapsible filter menu.
- **Budget settings** — Set a custom budget amount and choose weekly or monthly tracking. Settings persist across sessions.
- **Timezone-aware filtering** — Expenses are filtered by your local timezone, so "Today" always shows the correct local date.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) cluster

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mykola-Lopushenko/expense-tracker.git
cd expense-tracker
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
PORT=5000
```

Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

### 3. Set up the frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

> Make sure `API_URL` in `src/App.jsx` points to `http://localhost:5000` when running locally.

## Deployment (Render)

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Create a **Web Service** on Render pointing to the `backend/` folder.
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Start command: `node server.js`
   - Add `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` under Environment Variables.
3. Create a **Static Site** on Render pointing to the `frontend/` folder.

   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. Update `API_URL` in `App.jsx` to your backend Render URL before deploying the frontend.
